   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ErrorHandler's documentation!
========================================

This is a TEST!

Just testing some ReST for now, come back later for the real package!

.. topic:: myfile.py
   :class: file

   ::

        class MyClass:
           def something(self):
              pass

**myfile.py**::

        class MyClass:
           def something(self):
              pass

I wonder how topics render on PyPI?

.. function:: foo(x)

   :param x: blah
   :rtype: :class:`Bar`

   Return the foo.

How about :class:logging.Handler ?
