============
ErrorHandler
============

This is a handler for the python standard logging framework that can
be used to tell whether messages have been logged at or above a
certain level.

This can be useful when wanting to ensure that no errors have been
logged before committing data back to a database.

As an example, first, you set up the error handler:

>>> from errorhandler import ErrorHandler
>>> e = ErrorHandler()

Then you can log and check the handler at any point to see if it has
been triggered:

>>> from logging import getLogger
>>> e.fired
False
>>> logger.error('an error')

You use the `fired` attribute to only perform actions when no errors
have been logged:

>>> if e.fired:
...   print "Not updating files as errors have occurred"
Not updating files as errors have occurred
